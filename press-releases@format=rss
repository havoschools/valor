The location of the permanent campus is near the intersection of Ronald Reagan Boulevard and Highway 29, or more specifically at the intersection of County Road 267 and Kauffman Loop. It is conveniently located for families living in Leander, Georgetown, and Liberty Hill and is only 5.7 miles away from Valor Leander’s temporary site on Crystal Falls Parkway.&nbsp;</p><p class="">The acquired property includes 13.8 acres of land atop a hill with beautiful views and many trees. In addition to closing on the land, Valor has also been working with their architect and building partners to finalize the plans for a K-12 facility that will eventually house 1,550 students.&nbsp;</p><p class="">"It is truly an honor to bring our distinctive education to families in Leander, Georgetown, Liberty Hill, Cedar Park, and the surrounding area," said Valor Education's President and CEO David Williams. "We look forward to a transformative school experience where students and teachers alike are filled with joy and wonder as they immerse themselves in the classical tradition and experience <a href="https://www.valoreducation.org/the-valor-way" target="_blank">the Valor Way</a>." &nbsp;</p><p class="">Valor Leander opened their doors to students on August 16th at 906 Crystal Falls Parkway in Leander and plans to continue serving students in the rented facility until the funds can be raised to construct a permanent facility on the land. Valor is in the process of securing the philanthropy needed to move forward with construction with the hope of welcoming students to the permanent location in Fall 2025. However the timeline of the project and opening of the campus will largely depend upon the success of a capital campaign.&nbsp;</p><p class="">"These are exciting days for the Valor Leander community,” said Christopher Ochoa, Headmaster of Valor Leander. “We have already seen wonderful things happening in only our first few days of school! And yet, this is only just the beginning. This land will become a place of wonder and joy for generations to come. I am immensely grateful for the many supporters, faculty, parents, and students who have come together to make all this possible, and I am eager to work with them further to build on our new land soon!"&nbsp;</p>

The school located at 4300 Centerview Drive in northwest San Antonio will serve students in kindergarten through eighth grade in the 2023-2024 school year and will add a grade each subsequent year until it is a full K-12 school. Valor's distinctive schools offer students a fully human education rooted in the classical liberal arts tradition, from the Great Books to fine arts to advanced math and science, to wilderness expeditions and an impactful Human Encounter program. </p><p class="">Valor San Antonio is Valor Education’s fifth campus and the first to serve the greater San Antonio area. Valor received an “A” accountability rating as a district from the Texas Education Agency in 2022 based on student achievement, school progress, and closing education gaps of its students. </p><p class="">“It is a delight and an honor to meet with the eager families and students as we collectively prepare for a strong school start,” said Valor San Antonio’s Headmaster, Dr. Mark Discher. “The excitement is palpable among the faculty, the families, and the students. Valor offers something different—we educate the whole person, deeply investing in the character formation of our students and developing an abiding sense of wonder and love of learning. It is a place where children can grow in virtue, wisdom, and knowledge toward a full human life.” </p><p class="">Over the summer, Valor purchased a 93,000 square foot building on 11 acres of land in the vicinity of the Medical Center. The property was formerly owned by Southwest Business Corporation and was renovated to transform it into a school to serve students in the greater San Antonio community. Valor financed the purchase of the campus and funded the first phase of renovations with a loan from Equitable Facilities Fund, a nonprofit social impact fund that believes all children deserve a quality education.  </p><p class="">“We are deeply grateful for the many partners—community leaders, lenders, philanthropists, and our construction and design team—who came together to make Valor San Antonio a reality,” said David Williams, President and CEO of Valor Education. “This campus would not have been possible without the collaboration and goodwill of all who contributed. Families in Bexar County are eager for Valor’s K-12 tuition-free classical education, and we are excited about the positive impact Valor San Antonio will have for years to come.”  </p><p class="">Renovated by Bartlett Cocke General Contractors and designed by Haddon + Cowan Architects, the four-story campus will feature new classrooms, small group spaces, a multi-purpose cafeteria, community gardens, and a playground. An additional phase of renovations will include a gym to host athletics events and community gatherings, as well as a sports field to support Valor’s competitive athletics program.  </p><p class="">Valor Education continues to expand to serve the increasing demand for high quality, tuition-free K-12 classical education, with a new school in Leander opening this month, an expansion project underway at their North Austin campus, a new ground-up construction project for their South Austin campus, and plans to expand the Kyle campus in the near future. </p><p class=""><strong>ABOUT VALOR EDUCATION:</strong> </p><p class="">Valor Education exists to educate the whole person in authentic communities for a full human life.
